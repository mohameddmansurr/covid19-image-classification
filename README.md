# COVID-19 Image Classification Project

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model that classifies COVID-19 images. The project uses both a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.

## Project Overview
- **Dataset**: COVID-19 image dataset available on Kaggle.
- **Models**: MLP and CNN models for image classification.
- **Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow and Keras

## Repository Structure
- **models/**: Contains the trained models.
- **data/**: Placeholder for training and testing data. You will need to download the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and place it here.
- **src/**: Contains the Python scripts for training and predictions.
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python dependencies.
- **README.md**: Documentation for this project.
- **LICENSE**: The open-source license for the project.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/covid19-image-classification.git
   cd covid19-image-classification

## Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
